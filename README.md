# Aerobiome-Tracking

Overall tracking of the DFW aerobiome is the main goal but overall tracking the microbiota of enviroment and as well as pollen microplstics and carbon concestration


This is a data gathering project for Aerobiome to track what enviroment the organism are in. Pollen is  a subtrate of the aerobiome, now with increase in microplastics and carbon in the biome it would be good to perceive the microbiota under these conditions.

Alongside inorganics such as microplatics and increase of atomspheric hydrocarbons we also want to track the enviroment from the theoretical umwelt of most theorized microbiota within the enviroment, which would soil microorganisms and the microbiota from the surrounding foliage and animals.

Thank you,
